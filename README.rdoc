This is an app I've been developing to better understand Rails.

The basic functionality of the app is to log and track habits you are trying to start or break. It is said that if you can take an action 21 days, that action will become permanent.
Every habit starts with 21 days to follow your habit. If you have a failed day, 7 days are added to your habit. You can adjust this to between 0 and 7 days.

To help keep tabs on your progress, you can also enter notes for each day in each habit. These will potentially help you identify your struggling points and 

Every time you login, the app will run through each of your habits and update whether that habit is up to date or needs input from you. If you complete all days for your habit it will be marked complete and your habit is now finished. You then have the option of entering into a monitoring role of said habit and continue to track your progress.

The app was developed locally and pushed to github after completed. The commits are not well documented or coherent as they were meant for me alone.
