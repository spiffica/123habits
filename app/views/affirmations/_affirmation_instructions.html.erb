<p>Some people swear by affirmations, others view them with contempt. The choice is yours. If you dislike them, ignore this section and focus on your reasons and steps. If you embrace affirmations, chances are you already familiar with them and know what to do, so have at it. Write as many as you can come up with. Remember to state affirmations in the positive. For example: "I love fresh air", rather than "I hate the smell of cigarette smoke"</p>
<p>Recite these affirmations at least 3 times a day and every time you feel the urge to not follow through on your habit.</p>
